My job for this phase is, firstly, to implement the Log class and the GeneralFile class so as to make them mutually
Observable to each other, such that we are able to let these two classes notify each other when changes are made to
one of the classes. Then I turned to implement the TagManager class such that it now maintains a log file so as to
keep track of a global list of tags in the program. After finishing these tasks, I then joined my other teammates to
fix the bugs we found in the program.
