My job for this phase is, firstly, to implement the Log class and the GeneralFile class so as to make them mutually
Observable to each other, such that we are able to let these two classes notify each other when changes are made to
one of the classes. Then I turned to implement the TagManager class such that it now maintains a log file so as to
keep track of a global list of tags in the program. After finishing these tasks, I then joined my other teammates to
fix the bugs we found in the program.

In this phase, I implemented the multiple selection in all the three list view so that user can select multiple tags
at once and the selected tags then can be removed or added to the image file. Fixed bugs in the back end as well as
front end. Changed the way of adding the tags. Completed java docs of method. Implemented the string builder form in
 add or remove tags so tht the log file of the image should be changed once every time we add or remove multiple
 tags of a file.
