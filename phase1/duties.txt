It was great working on this assignment with my group. Everyone did their best to contribute to the project and did
a great job finishing their assigned duties. I was handling the front end bits and pieces of back end as well. In
building the gui Elliot and Jeremy helped me, guided me and did a great job explaining the back end which helped in merging the
back end with front fairly simple.
